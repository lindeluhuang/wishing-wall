# The Wishing Wall

This is a simple app that shows a wishing wall where you can see wishes, like wishes, and make your own wish. Try it out! 

## Disclaimers

Note #1: At the moment I’ve only built the front-end, so no information is saved once the page is refreshed. Think of it as a fresh start...

Note #2: Because of some weird github pages hosting thingies, if you refresh the page it doesn’t recognize the new route. If you want to start over, just click the link again and you’ll be on your merry way!
